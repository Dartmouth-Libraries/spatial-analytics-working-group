## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Set working directory
#setwd('~/Downloads')
setwd('~/Desktop/rspatialworkshop')


# Load required libraries
library(sp)         # For spatial objects and functionalities
library(sf)         # For handling simple features
library(terra)      # For working with raster and vector data
library(maps)       # For plotting maps

library(tidyverse)

# Unzip the dataset containing parks
unzip(zipfile = "nationalparks.zip", exdir = "data")

# Load sightings data using read.csv
points <- read.csv('bear-sightings.csv')

# Convert the data frame to a simple features object
points_sf <- st_as_sf(points, coords = c('longitude', 'latitude'), crs = 4326)  # Let's set CRS to WGS84 directly

# Plot  locations
plot(st_geometry(points_sf), main = "point locations")

# Add a coarse map layer for context using maps package
map("world", region="usa", add=TRUE)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
