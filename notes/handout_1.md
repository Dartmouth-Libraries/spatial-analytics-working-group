Afternoon task - group project #1

With your team, spend 5-10 minutes discussing and deciding on something
(a theme that can be represented by a set of geographic features) that 
you'd like to map using Python.  

Spend about 10 to 15 minutes researching available datasets.  
If no datasets are available, consider changing the theme, or consider 
developing an approximation, or model, of the theme's features using a tool 
like https://geojson.io 

Spend the next 10 to 15 minutes to create a map! Use the tools you've learned earlier today.  
See if you can use different symbol types and symbol colors, and code in pop-up boxes 
for your features.  Consult the documentation at the various Python libraries' websites.  

Send your code, and your data, through chat, Google Drive or Etherpad 
if you'd like it displayed on the big screen.
